# A-secretive-Telegram-bot-for-capturing-photos-from-a-webcam
This project is a secretive Python script that captures a photo from a webcam, sends it via Telegram, and deletes all traces of its work, including self-destruction. The program runs in the background, without displaying any messages or windows.
